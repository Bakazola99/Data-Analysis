🧰 What's Inside
This repository is structured to guide you through the full data analysis process, from initial data cleaning to advanced statistical analysis. Here’s a look at some of the core sections:

🔹 1. Data Wrangling & Cleaning
Data Cleaning Scripts: Scripts to handle missing data, outlier detection, and data type conversions in R.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Tools and code snippets to examine data distributions, identify patterns, and summarize key metrics.
Data Transformation: Code for aggregating, reshaping, and normalizing datasets to prepare them for analysis.
🔹 2. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and interpret measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation with ease.
Hypothesis Testing: T-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, and other statistical tests to help you draw meaningful conclusions.
Regression Models: Implement linear, logistic, and multiple regression models.
🔹 3. Data Visualization
Basic Visualizations: Generate histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and more with R ggplot2.
Advanced Visualizations: Create interactive dashboards, geospatial maps, and custom visualizations to tell compelling data stories.
🔹 4. Machine Learning Integration
Predictive Modeling: scripts for building and evaluating machine learning models like decision trees, k-means clustering, and random forests.
Feature Engineering: Tools to extract, transform, and select features that improve model performance.
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and other metrics to assess model accuracy.
